- How managing low-quality wood (also known as low-use wood) for bioenergy can encourage sustainable forest management
- A  A tree's 'value' depends on several factors including its species, size, form, condition, quality, function, and accessibility, and depends on the management goals for a given forest. The same tree can be valued very differently by each person who looks at it. A large, straight black [[Cherry]] tree has high value as [[Timber]] to be cut into logs or made into furniture, but for a [[Landowner]] more interested in wildlife habitat, the real value of that [[Stem]] (or [[Trunk]]) may be the food it provides to animals. Likewise, if the tree suffers from black knot disease, its value for timber decreases, but to a woodworker interested in making bowls, it brings an opportunity for a unique and beautiful piece of art.
- B   In the past, Pennsylvania landowners were solely interested in the value of their trees as high-quality timber. The [[Norm]] was to remove the stems of highest quality and leave behind poorly formed trees that were not as well suited to the site where they grew. This practice, called 'high-grading', has left a [[Legacy]] of 'low-use wood' in the forests. Some people even call these 'junk trees', and they are abundant in Pennsylvania. These trees have lower economic value for traditional timber markets, compete for growth with higher-value trees, shade out desirable regeneration and decrease the health of a stand* leaving it more vulnerable to poor weather and disease. Management that specifically targets low-use wood can help landowners manage these forest health issues, and wood energy markets help [[Promote]] this.
- C   Wood energy markets can accept less expensive wood material of lower quality than would be suitable for traditional timber markets. Most wood used for energy in Pennsylvania is used to produce heat or electricity through combustion. Many schools and hospitals use wood boiler systems to heat and power their facilities, many homes are primarily heated with wood, and some coal plants incorporate wood into their coal streams to produce electricity. Wood can also be gasified for electrical generation and can even be made into liquid fuels like ethanol and gasoline for lorries and cars. All these products are made primarily from low-use wood. Several tree- and plant-cutting approaches, which could greatly improve the long-term quality of a forest, focus strongly or solely on the use of wood for those markets. Stand - An area covered with trees that have common features (e.g. size)
- D   One such approach is called a Timber Stand Improvement (TSI) Cut. In a TSI Cut, really poor-quality tree and plant material is cut down to allow more space, light, and other resources to the highest-valued stems that remain. Removing [[Invasive]] plants might be another primary goal of a TSI Cut. The stems that are left behind might then grow in size and develop more [[Foliage]] and larger crowns or tops that produce more [[Coverage]] for wildlife; they have a better chance to regenerate in a less crowded environment. TSI Cuts can be [tailored]([[Tailor]]) to one farmer's specific management goals for his or her land.
- E   Another approach that might [[Yield]] a high amount of low-use wood is a Salvage Cut. With the many [pests]([[Pest]]) and [pathogens]([[Pathogen]]) visiting forests including hemlock wooly adelgid, Asian long horned [[Beetle]], emerald ash borer, and gypsy moth, to name just a few, it is important to remember that those working in the forests can help ease these issues through cutting procedures. These types of cut reduce the number of sick trees and seek to manage the future spread of a pest problem. They leave [[Vigorous]] trees that have stayed healthy enough to survive the [[Outbreak]].
- F   A Shelterwood Cut, which only takes place in a mature forest that has already been thinned several times, involves removing all the mature trees when other seedlings have become established. This then allows the forester to decide which tree species are regenerated. It leaves a young forest where all trees are at a similar point in their growth. It can also be used to develop a two-[[Tier]] forest so that there are two harvests and the money that comes in is spread out over a decade or more.
- G   Thinning and dense and dead wood removal for fire prevention also center on the production of low-use wood. However, it is important to remember that some [[Retention]] of what many would classify as low-use wood is very important. The tops of trees that have been cut down should be left on the site so that their nutrients cycle back into the soil. In addition, trees with many [cavities]([[Cavity]]) are extremely important habitats for insect [predators]([[Predator]]) like woodpeckers, [bats]([[Bat]]) and small [mammals]([[Mammal]]). They help control problem insects and increase the health and [[Resilience]] of the forest. It is also important to remember that not all small trees are low-use. For example, many species like hawthorn provide food for wildlife. Finally, rare species of trees in a forest should also stay behind as they add to its structural diversity.
