- In Paris, [[Urban]] farmers are trying a soil-free approach to [[Agriculture]] that uses less space and fewer resources.
- Could it help cities face the threats to our food supplies?
- On top of a striking new [[Exhibition]] [[Hall]] in southern Paris, the world's largest urban rooftop farm has started to [[Bear]] fruit.
- Strawberries that are small, intensely [flavored]([[Flavor]]) and [[Resplendently]] red [[Sprout]] abundantly from large plastic tubes.
- [[Peer]] inside and you see the tubes are completely [[Hollow]], the roots of [dozens]([[Dozen]]) of strawberry plants [dangling]([[Dangle]]) down inside them.

- From identical vertical tubes nearby [[Burst]] row upon row of [lettuces]([[Lettuce]]).
- near those are [[Aromatic]] herbs, such as Basil, Sage and Peppermint.
- Opposite, in narrow, horizontal [trays]([[Tray]]) packed not with soil but with [[Coconut]] [[Fibre]], grow [[Cherry]] tomatoes, shiny [[Aubergine]] and brightly coloured [chards]([[Chard]]).

- Pascal Hardy, an engineer and [[Sustainable]] development consultant, began experimenting with vertical farming and aeroponic growing towers - as the soil-free plastic tubes are known - on his Paris apartment block roof five years ago.

- The urban rooftop space above the exhibition hall is somewhat bigger: 14,000 square metres and almost exactly the size of a couple of football [pitches]([[Pitch]]).
- Already, the team of young urban farmers who tend it have picked, in one day, 3,000 lettuces and 150 pun nets of strawberries.
- When the remaining two thirds of the [[Vast]] open area are in production, 20 staff will harvest up to 1,000 kg of perhaps 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables, every day.
- 'We're not ever, obviously, going to feed the whole city this way,' [cautions]([[Caution]]) Hardy. '
- In the urban environment you're working with very significant [[Practical]] constraints, clearly, on what you can do and where.
- But if enough unused space can be developed like this, there's no reason why you shouldn't eventually target maybe between 5% and 10% of consumption.'
- Perhaps most significantly, however, this is a real-life [[Showcase]] for the work of Hardy's [flourishing]([[Flourish]]) urban agriculture consultancy, Agripolis, which is currently fielding [enquiries]([[Enquire]]) from around the world to design, build and equip a new [[Breed]] of soil-free inner-city farm.
- 'The method's advantages are many,' he says. 'First, I don't much like the fact that most of the fruit and vegetables we eat have been treated with something like 17 different [pesticides]([[Pesticide]]), or that the intensive farming techniques that produced them are such huge generators of greenhouse gases.
- I don't much like the fact, either, that they've travelled an average of 2,000 [refrigerated]([[Refrigerate]]) kilometers to my [[Plate]], that their quality is so poor, because the varieties are selected for their capacity to withstand such [[Substantial]] journeys, or that 80% of the price I pay goes to wholesalers and transport companies, not the producers.'
