- That must mean the park's as large as several [[Baseball]] stadiums.
- From the playground to the Tear down to each individual [[Blade]] of grass, has been [meticulously]([[Meticulous]]) placed.
- Even the park is [elevated]([[Elevate]]) to a work of fine art. The town's focus on the arts is truly [astounding]([[Astound]]).

- There's a huge [[Fountain]] that [spews]([[Spew]]) [[Insane]] amounts of water and a [[Bunch]] of iron bars [twisted]([[Twist]]) into nonsensical shapes if you keep walking.

- At any rate, it all seems on [[Brand]] with the [[Artistic]] [sensibilities]([[Sensibility]]) of the artist who created it all.

- ## 开始逛商品区
- You should definitely check out the [[Thrift]] shop.
- The [[Donut]] shop is by far the best, in my opinion.
- [[Munch]], munch. These donuts are so [[Yummy]].
- The [sneakers]([[Sneaker]]) I pointed out are pretty [[Tasty]], too.
- One [[Stall]] stood out amongst the rest, a wide variety of [[Merchandise]] [[Prominently]] on display. #card

- From the way he's talking, it sounds like he'll [escorting]([[Escort]]) us to the meeting spot.
