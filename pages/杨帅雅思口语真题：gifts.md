- How often do you buy others gifts?
-
- Well, how often I buy other people presents depends on how often my friends or family members have birthday parties or how often there's a special occasion like, I don't know, Mother's Day or [[Valentine]]'s Day. So I only buy other people gifts on those special occasions. Well, the last time I bought someone something was about two months ago. It was one of my best friend's birthday, and I was invited to the party. Of course, he was my best friend. So I spent about two days considering what to buy him. And at at last I decided to buy him a bike because he was really into cycling at that time.

- Do you like to give others expensive gifts?
-
- No I don't think so, this is not because I don't want to buy other people pricey presents, it's just that I am just a student and I don't really have that much money, so I can't afford to buy other people expensive gifts. Maybe in the future after working for a few years after, I mean, when I have accumulated in some sort of wealth, I will begin buying other people expensive things.

- What kinds of gifts are popular in China?
-
- Well, many kinds of presents are well liked in my country, including chocolates, flowers, I mean [bouquets]([[Bouquet]]) of flowers and books, absolutely, because books are treasure, twelves of information, right? So I mean some people, especially those, I guess university students and high school students, are particularly into buying other people books. And this is something that I like to do. When I was in high school. One reason was that I was quite fond of reading, and I just naturally figured that all my friends were into reading as well. Another reason is that, you know, books are cheap, right? So when I bought a book for other people, it wouldn't cost me a lot of money.

- Why do people give gifts?
-
- Well, off the top of my head, giving gifts to other people is just a way of maintaining our relationship with them. It's not really, it's just a symbol of, I don't know, I don't know really, honestly, I have no idea how to put it. I think it's just represents our friendship, right? For example, if I'm invited to a wedding [[Ceremony]], a wedding of one of my best friends and I buy them a bouquet of flowers, I give it to them, I mean, it's not like they're going to keep the flowers forever, but when I buy it for them, they know that, you know, I have them in mind, right? I care about them and I treasure our friendship.
