- ―――――When I came to, I was in a burning field.
  I guess there was a big fire.
  The familiar town had turned to ashes and it looked like the remains of a
  battlefield from a movie.
  ―――But that didn't last long either.
  The fire had died down by the time the sun rose.
  The tall wall of flame火焰 had shortened, and most of the buildings had
  fallen.
  ...It felt strange, being the only thing in that place that still had its
  original form.
  I was the only one still alive around here.
  I must have been really lucky, or my house was built in a very lucky
  spot位置.
  I don't know which it was, but the point is, I was the only one left alive.
  I felt that since I survived, I should live on.
  I started walking aimlessly, because I thought it would be dangerous just
  to stay there.
  I wasn't really concerned about getting burned up like the people lying
  around me.
  ...Probably because, over and above not wanting to be like them, I had a
  stronger feeling in my mind.
  But still, I had no hope.
  It was already a wonder奇迹 I was still alive, so I couldn't expect to be
  saved.
  I won't survive.
  Whatever happens, I won't be able to escape from this red world.
  It was such an absolute hell that even a small child could understand it.
  And I collapsed倒下.
  Was it because there was no air? Was it because no function was left in
  my body?
- Anyway, I collapsed and stared up at the clouded sky.
  Everything around me was burned up and I could see many shriveled
  people.
  The dark clouds loomed朦胧地现出 overhead, telling me it would rain soon.
  ...That's good. The fire will be put out once it rains.
  In the end, I sighed deeply and looked up at the sky.
  I say to myself that it hurts.
  I say so on behalf of all the people who couldn't even say so.
  ―――That was ten years ago.
  After that, I was miraculously神奇地 saved.
  My body survived.
  But I think all the other things about me burned up and were reduced to
  ashes.
  If you take away a child's parents, home, and all such things, there's
  nothing left for him.
  That's why there was only my body.
  I think it's a simple story.
  In other words, in order to let my body live...
  My heart died.
  ―――――――――I'm dreaming.
  "――――Huh!?"
  I squint斜视 my eyes at the white light.
  "So bright", I think.
  It was just light entering my eyes when I woke up, but I'm not used to it.
  I probably didn't even understand what the bright light meant.
  "Huh?"
  When my eyes focus, I'm surprised.
  I'm lying on an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar room.
  I'm surprised, but the room is so white and clean that I feel safe.
  "...Where am I?"
  I look around.
  The room is big and there are many beds.
  A person is in each bed, and everyone seems to be hurt.
- But nothing feels ill in this room.
  Everyone who's hurt is someone who was saved.
  "――――"
  I relax and let my eyes wander.
  ――――Outside the window,
  The bright blue sky was unbelievably beautiful.
  After a few days, I finally understood.
  I could clearly remember what had happened in the past few days.
  Even so, I was no different from a newborn baby.
  Not just a metaphor隐喻, it was close to the truth.
  Anyway, it was a terrible fire.
  I had been saved from it, was in the hospital with my body wrapped包裹 in
  bandages, and my parents were gone.
  I didn't get the situation, but I vaguely understood that I was alone.
  I think I understood quickly.
  ...Well, there was nothing but children in similar situations around me,
  so all I could do was absorb the fact.
  ―――And after that.
  That man came, right when I was beginning to worry what would
  happen to me next.
  He came on the day my bandages were taken off and I was able to eat
  without help.
  Wrinkled褶皱的 coat and uncombed蓬乱的 hair.
  The man, a bit younger than the doctor, felt more like a big brother than
  a father.
  "Hello. You must be Shirou-kun."
  A smile that seems to melt into the white sunlight.
  I think it was a suspicious voice, but a very kind voice.
  "I'll ask you directly. Which would you prefer? To go to an orphanage,
  or to be adopted by this man you've never seen before?"
  That man was saying he could adopt me.
  When I asked him if he was a relative of mine, he said he was just a
  stranger.
- ..He looked like an unreliable guy with no future.
  But it made no difference, as I knew nothing about either one: him or the
  orphanage.
  So I decided to go with him.
  "I see, that's good. Get ready quickly, then. You should get used to your
  new place as fast as you can."
  The guy quickly started packing my stuff.
  His packing wasn't very good, even in the eyes of a child.
  Then, after making a big mess...
  "Oh, I forgot to mention something important.
  I have to tell you one thing before you come with me.
  Is that okay?"
  He turns to me lightheartedly and says,
  "Yeah.
  To start off with, I'm a sorcerer."
  He says it in a serious, exaggerated tone.
  It happened in an instant.
  Come to think of it now, I was really a child back then.
  I automatically believed those words.
  "―――Wow, you're awesome."
  I guess I said so with bright eyes.
  Since that time, I became his child.
  Actually, I don't remember what I said back then.
  But my father would always talk about that day.
  He would remember and retell the story again and again.
  So for my father, Emiya Kiritsugu, that might have been the happiest
  day of his life.
  ...So.
  I guess it was strange for my father to tell me that he was a sorcerer, but
  I was strange as well for admiring that.
  And thus, I became an adopted son, and my last name became Emiya.
  Emiya Shirou.
- When I said my name, I was really proud of having the same last name
  as Kiritsugu.
  ...I'm dreaming.
  A story from my childhood.
  It was when I finally convinced my father to make me his student, so it
  must have been about eight years ago.
  When I was old enough to stay at home by myself, Kiritsugu started to
  leave the house on a regular basis.
  He would say in his normal tone that he would "travel the world", and he
  began to act on these words.
  That's how it was after that.
  It was normal for him to leave the house empty for a month, and he
  sometimes wouldn't come home for half a year.
  The Emiya house is a big Japanese-style house, and Kiritsugu and I were
  the only ones living there.
  I was perplexed in this house at times, as it was too big for a child.
  But still, I liked my life here.
  Emiya Kiritsugu would come home from his journeys and tell me lots of
  stories like a child.
  And the child who shared his last name would be at home waiting for
  those stories.
  I was always alone in the house, but that loneliness would all fade with
  the stories he brought back.
  ―――The father who was always chasing his dreams like a kid.
  His attitude was astounding, but he always seemed dazzling to me.
  That might be why I wanted to be like him someday.
  ...Well, on top of that....
  Looking at my ever-dreaming father, I felt I should become reliable
  myself――――
  ...I hear a sound.
  I hear a heavy, old, rusty sound as the door opens.
  Light enters the dark shed.
  "――――Uh."
- My mind, waking up...
  "Senpai, are you awake?"
  ...Feels the cold air and the approaching footsteps.
  "...Mm. Good morning, Sakura."
  "Ah, yes. Good morning, Senpai."
  Sakura smiles and nods as if accustomed to this situation.
  "Senpai, it's morning already. You have some more time, but Fujimura-
  Sensei will get mad if you stay asleep here."
  "Oh... you're right. Thanks for coming to wake me up."
  "It's no problem at all. You're always up so early.
  I can only come and wake you up like this occasionally."
  ...?
  Sakura seems more upbeat than usual today as if she's happy about
  something.
  "...Really? I think you wake me up quite often.
  Though, Fuji-Nee always hits me to wake me up, so I'd rather have you
  wake me up... Well, I'll try harder next time."
  ...I answer her with a sleepy head.
  I don't know what I'm saying with my mind not fully awake.
  "All right. But I'm happier when you don't try."
  Sakura is giggling.
  ...Gah, I guess my head was still dozing and I said something weird.
  "―――Give me a second, I'll wake up."
  Taking a deep breath, I clear up my mind.
  The cold outdoor air helps in situations like this.
  The chill works well to beat the sleepiness out of my head.
  ...In front of me is Matou Sakura, my junior at school.
  This place is a shed behind my house, and the time is six o'clock.
  "...Senpai?"
  ;//splitted
  "Yeah, I'm awake now. Sorry, I guess I did it again.[l]
  I have to help you cook breakfast too."
- "It's fine. You were up late last night again, right? So you should take
  your time in the morning.
  I'll get breakfast ready."
  Sakura says so in a happy tone.
  ...It's unusual. Sakura really seems to be in a good mood this morning.
  "I can't let you do that. I'll get up right now, so let's go to the kitchen
  together."
  "All right, I'm all set. Let's go, Sakura."
  "Ah... um, Senpai..."
  "Hm? What, is something wrong?"
  "No, it's nothing, but... I think you should change before you go back to
  the house."
  "―――Oh."
  That said, I look down at myself.
  I fell asleep while I was working, so I'm still wearing my overalls.
  Being my work clothes, they're pretty dirty. I can't imagine what Fuji-
  Nee would say to me if I went into the house like this.
  "Ugh... I guess I'm not awake yet. I'm a bit out of it this morning."
  "That could be. So you rest here for a bit and I'll take care of breakfast.
  And you know, if you keep this place a mess, Fujimura-Sensei will get
  mad at you."
  "...You're right. I'll go after I get changed. You go on ahead."
  "Yes, I'll be waiting, Senpai."
  Sakura leaves.
  Well.
  I have to change into my school uniform and clear up this mess.
  The shed is built on the edge of our yard, and just as it seems, it's a
  warehouse we put all our junk in.
  But for me, it's a place of treasures as I've enjoyed messing with things
  since I was a kid.
  Father didn't allow me to go into the shed, but I always sneaked in here.
  As a result, it became my base.
  For me, Emiya Shirou, I guess you could call this place my real room.
- The big Emiya household doesn't suit me, and I can only relax in this
  space full of junk.
  "...Besides, it's a waste. Even if it's junk, you can still use it."
  Most of the things in here are appliances that can't be used any more.
  Did I bring all the junk in here because I liked the place, or did I come to
  like it here because of all the junk?
  Anyway, since I was always sneaking in here, it became my hobby to fix
  the broken things.
  It's not like I get attached to things.
  I think it just annoys me not to use things that can still be used.
  And just like that, I was fixing up this stove all last night.
  "...I guess I'll finish this tomorrow. It seems I don't have enough
  concentration, seeing how I fell asleep halfway."
  I shake off the feeling of disappointment in myself.
  I gather up the parts of the stove and put them on the shelf full of things
  waiting to be fixed.
  There are no spaces on this shelf full of things awaiting repair. An old
  VCR awaits after the stove.
  ...I guess I'll ignore the fact that Fuji-Nee broke both of them.
  "...All right."
  I change into my uniform.
  This place is like my room, and it holds changes of clothes along with
  other things I need.
  It also has lots of blueprints and junk, the result of failures from when I
  do my training.
  There's also some kind of old design inscribed on the floor, like an altar
  or something.
  "―――Well, let's get today started."
  Clapping my hands in prayer to the shed, I head for the house.
  I emerge from the shed.
  The Emiya house is a Japanese-style house on the outskirts of town.
  My father wasn't much of a respected person in town, but he somehow
  still had this huge house.
- That on its own is a mystery, but it also seems he didn't have any
  relatives in Japan.
  That's why the house became mine and no one else's when my father
  died.
  Though, to be honest, I don't have that kind of management ability.
  Old Man Fujimura is in charge of complicated things like inheritance
  and property taxes.
  Old Man Fujimura is the big landlord in this neighborhood.
  According to Father, "the old man's like a yakuza boss".
  Of course, this is just prejudice.
  He's not "like" a yakuza boss, he "is" a yakuza boss.
  "......"
  Well, that's a problem in itself, but I prefer to ignore it.
  It's certainly true that he's energetic and scary, but he's actually not that
  bad a person.
  It really helps me as he pays a lot when I tune-up the motorcycle he likes
  to ride.
  Anyway, that's why I'm the only one living in this big house.
  It's been five years since Father died.
  The days have passed quickly.
  I sigh, thinking about how much I've grown in those five years.
  I've trained every day to be like Kiritsugu, but it's not that easy in
  reality.
  It's natural because I had no talent to begin with, but what can be said
  about having no improvement at all in five years?
  To sum up the present in one sentence, my goal is so far away that I'm
  not even at the starting line yet.
  "―――――――"
  No, I guess it won't do any good to rush.
  For now, I have to do what I can.
  Well then.
  Right now, I should go and finish my daily routine.
  The Emiya house has a big dojo.
- It was built when the house was built.
  It was only intended as a hobby, so the dojo wasn't built for any
  particular purpose.
  "――――Well."
  I'll warm up a bit before breakfast.
  I'm not really studying martial arts, but since Father told me "if you want
  to be like me, you'll have to train your body first", it became my daily
  routine to work out.
  "...Ninety-nine, one hundred..."
  I finish my routine sit-ups and change out of my gi into my uniform.
  I slept in this morning, so I cut short of my workout.
  Some sit-ups with no stretching should be enough.
  I'm not the kind to build up a lot of muscle, and it's not like I want to get
  into a fight.
  All I need is enough athletic ability to handle sudden accidents, and to
  move as I wish when I have to.
  After all, the thing I want to become is the complete opposite of an
  athlete.
  "...Oh, this late already?"
  I put the sweaty gi into the laundry basket.
  It's 6:20.
  In our house, even this is a late time for breakfast.
  Breakfast is already prepared.
  I can smell the elegant scent of breakfast befitting Sakura.
  "Breakfast is ready, Senpai."
  "Yeah, thanks... sorry, you had to do more work because I slept in."
  "No, it's no work at all. Besides, you didn't sleep in. This is early for you
  since you're not in any clubs."
  "Clubs have nothing to do with it. When you bring clubs into it, you
  have to wake up early to come here when you have morning practice."
  "Ah... no, I'm doing this because I want to, so please don't worry about
  my club."
  "Yeah, you always say that.
- Well, that's why I wake up early, clubs or not. It's rude for me to sleep in
  if you're going to be here."
  For me, waking up early is waking up before Sakura gets here, and
  sleeping in is making Sakura prepare breakfast on her own―――like
  today.
  Though, this has only been a habit for a year and a half or so.
  "Heehee. Senpai, you always put too much weight on these things.
  Mitsuzuri-Senpai always says you're so honest that it's annoying."
  Sakura smiles, as if remembering it.
  Mitsuzuri is the captain of the archery club Sakura is in, and someone I
  have a lot of acquaintance with.
  "...Huh. Is she still complaining to you about me?"
  "Yes. She's working hard every day to beat you in archery before she
  graduates."[l]
  "...Geez, she must be better than me by now. Is she just glorifying the
  memories? I don't mind people thinking highly of me, but I guess it
  depends on who they are."
  "Mitsuzuri-Senpai hates losing, so she probably thinks of you as a
  rival."[l]
  Sakura puts rice into a bowl as she talks.
  It's almost six thirty.
  The archery club's morning practice starts at seven.
  It's not mandatory, but she can't afford to take it easy.
  "Fuji-Nee... will be here soon, I guess. Well, it's her fault for not getting
  here on time. Well, Sakura, let's go ahead and start eating."
  "Yes. Here you go, Senpai."
  Sakura hands me the bowl with a smile.
  "――――――――"
  ...Then.
  I'm used to this every morning, but her white fingers catch my eye.
  "――――!!"
  ...How can I put this... it's troubling.
  She must be maturing as she seems really feminine these days.
- Her casual movements are beautiful and she often takes my breath
  away.
  Perhaps it's a reaction to not feeling anything for her until now, but I'm
  noticing more and more feminine characteristics in her...
  "Senpai? Is something wrong?"
  "―――No, it's nothing. Don't worry, it's nothing."
  "Hm?"
  ...Honestly.
  Why am I feeling tense around my friend's sister?
  She's a good underclassman and a junior I need to take care of.
  First of all, the relationship between me and Matou Sakura is just that of
  a Senpai and a junior.
  She's the sister of a close friend of mine, but since she's a grade below
  me, we weren't that close.
  It all changed a year and a half ago into this cooperative kind of
  relationship.
  Sakura came to cook when I was injured, and after that, I think we just
  ended up like this.
  ...I think we intended to do it until my injury healed, but some trivial
  thing came up to make her stay with it.
  Anyways, Sakura is a good cook, and perfect at cleaning and doing the
  laundry.
  It's a big help to have her helping around here in the mornings, but it's
  been a bit troubling recently.
  The problem is not in Sakura, but me.
  "――――"
  Frankly, Sakura is beautiful.
  She's one of the best looking first years, and I'm sure there are lots of
  guys who want to date her.
  And on top of that, she's been growing in certain places recently and
  some of her casual gestures have started to catch my eye.
  ...That's what I mean by a small problem.
  Maybe I'm just feeling guilty about being attracted to my friend's sister.
- Usually I'm fine, but when I'm caught off guard like just now, I blush...
  does this make me an unsuitable Senpai...?
  Breakfast is placed on the table.
  A perfect breakfast consisting of chicken salad, cooked salmon, spinach,
  radish and carrot miso soup, and yam soup.
  Sakura and I bow and start our meal quietly.
  The sounds of our chopsticks echo.
  Sakura isn't the talkative type, and I'm not versatile enough to talk while
  eating.
  Naturally, mealtimes are quiet.
  Usually it's louder, but today, the loud person is...
  She must have been watching spy movies last night as she's eyeing us
  while hiding behind a newspaper.
  "Fujimura-Sensei, don't you think you shouldn't read the newspaper
  during meals?"
  "......"
  Fuji-Nee ignores Sakura's question.
  She's acting weird, but Fuji-Nee always acts in suspicious ways during
  breakfast.
  Sakura must be used to it, as she continues to eat with no particular
  care.
  Sakura prefers to make Western foods.
  She learned to cook Japanese food after she started coming here to help.
  Fuji-Nee and I preferred Japanese, so Sakura learned to make Japanese
  food for our breakfast.
  Now she's so good that she's almost surpassed me, her teacher.
  The salmon is especially good as it's cooked to perfection.
  Her miso soup is tasty, and she has shown some capacity even for
  making yam soup by grinding yams.
  Actually, I think this is the first time she's made it.
  "Sorry, Sakura, can you pass me the soy sauce?"
  "There you... oh wait, Senpai. Your soy sauce is empty."
  "Fuji-Nee's will do then. Can you get it?"
- "May I, Fujimura-Sensei?"
  Fuji-Nee nods.
  Her newspaper trembles.
  "There you go. Are you going to use it on the yam soup?"
  "Yeah, you usually put soy sauce on yam soup, right?"
  I put the soy sauce onto the white yam soup.
  After stirring it, I put it on the rice and take a bite.
  Mm, the stickiness of the yam and the taste of the soy sau――――
  "Ugh...! This is terrible! This is oyster sauce!"
  I almost throw it back up.
  And then,
  "Haha, ahahahahahaha!"
  Fuji-Nee throws her newspaper away.
  "How's that? It was my plan to switch the labels earlier this morning!"
  The female spy throws up her arms to show her happiness.
  "W-What are you thinking!? You're always like this even though you'll
  be turning twenty-five this year!"
  "Haha. Did it teach you a lesson for what you did yesterday?
  It's divine justice for picking on me with everyone else."
  "Divine justice doesn't come from people! I thought you were calm, but
  this is what you were thinking about!?"
  "That's right. That's why I have to go and start grading the exams now.
  Yup, I should hurry up."
  Fuji-Nee sits back down and finishes her breakfast quickly.
  "Thank you. Breakfast was lovely as always, Sakura-chan."
  "Ah... thank you, Sensei."
  "I'm going on ahead then. I'll get mad if you two are late."
  And she runs off.
  ...There's something wrong with a world in which that thing is a teacher.
  "...Um, Senpai?"
  "Sorry about that. Fuji-Nee didn't really take the time to enjoy your
  breakfast."
- "No, it's not that. Um... did you do something to her yesterday? It's a bit
  too much for Fujimura-Sensei to play with food."
  "Uh... well, yeah. I accidentally called her by her nickname."
  "I guess it can't be helped in that case. You didn't apologize to her, did
  you, Senpai?"
  "Sorry. I forgot since it happens all the time."
  "You mustn't. Fujimura-Sensei doesn't like you calling her so, Senpai.
  You made her cry again, didn't you?"
  "...I made her run away too. Yesterday's English lesson was a self-study
  because of it."
  And I was awarded a student honor written on note paper, but I threw it
  away.
  "Geez. It was all your fault, then."
  Fuji-Nee is like a big sister for Sakura, so she's basically on Fuji-Nee's
  side.
  That's good in its own way, but I wish she'd consider my situation where
  I have to deal with Fuji-Nee 24-7.
  Fuji-Nee was originally an acquaintance of Father's, and she's been
  coming to the house a lot since I was adopted.
  She started to show up even more after Father died, and she's now
  almost a dependent, eating breakfast and dinner here.
  ―――No.
  Maybe she's why I was able to make it on my own even after my father
  died.
  Fuji-Nee, Sakura, and I are now the residents of the Emiya household.
  ...But I'm the only one who knows that my father was a magus.
  It's said that magi must hide their identities.
  That's why I've been hiding the fact that I'm learning magic ever since I
  became my father's student.
  I say I'm learning, but I can't even cast a single magic spell properly.
  With this kind of a skill, it wouldn't make much difference whether I
  hide it or not. But because it was how my father wanted things, I've
  trained secretly since then.
- I finish breakfast and prepare for school.
  I clean the dishes with Sakura while listening to the news on TV.
  "―――"
  Sakura is staring at the TV screen.
  Over the screen runs an exaggerated teletype reading "Gas Leak
  Accidents Continue".
  It seems there was a big accident in the neighboring town of Shinto.
  It happened in a building in the business district. It seems a whole floor
  of people ran out of oxygen and fell unconscious.
  They've called it a gas leak, but this kind of accident is happening often
  recently.
  "Are you worried about the news, Sakura?"
  "Eh? No, not really. I just thought it's near... Senpai, your workplace is in
  the Shinto area, right?"
  "Yeah, but it's not really a big place. I don't think an accident like that
  would happen there."
  ...But it's not a risk I can completely ignore.
  Gas leaks can happen in any building, and on top of that, it hurts to think
  that hundreds of people are suffering.
  It's said that the accidents are happening often because of defective
  construction work during the rapid development of Shinto.
  Whether that's true or not, I certainly don't want any more
  victims―――
  "...It is dangerous. We'll have to be careful here too."
  "Oh, don't worry, Senpai. I check the gas twice every time."
  Sakura boasts with pride.
  "No, that's not the point."
  ...Yeah, I've thought so before, but Sakura is a bit off too.
  "Senpai, did you lock the back door?"
  "I did. I bolted it. Is there a problem?"
  "Not at all. Then I'll lock the front door now. When will you be home
  today, Senpai?"
  "I think I'll be a bit late. What about you, Sakura?"
- "I'll be back at the usual time. I'll probably be here earlier, so I'll start
  getting dinner ready."
  "...Yeah, that'll help. I'll try to come home early too."
  We lock the gate.
  Sakura and Fuji-Nee also have keys to my house, and the rule is that the
  last person out locks up.
  "Let's go. You won't make it to morning practice unless we hurry."
  "Yes, let's hurry then, Senpai."
  We walk down to the town together.
  Passing the long wall and going downhill, we reach the residential
  district.
  My house is on top of the hill, far away from the center of town.
  Going down the hill takes us to the residential district, and beyond
  that...
  We reach the crossroads at the center of this town.
  From here, there are many roads: a big bridge leading to the neighboring
  city...
  ...A hill road that leads to Ryudou Temple...
  ...The residential district on the other side of town...
  ...The shopping district Sakura and I always use...
  ...And the school we're headed to right now.
  We head for the school without stopping elsewhere.
  We don't talk much as we walk up the hill.
  Since it's still seven o'clock, there aren't many others on the road.
  Other than us, all you can see are a few others heading to their morning
  practices.
  "Well, see ya. Have fun at your club."
  I part with Sakura at the school gate like usual.
  Sakura's in the archery club, so we have to part here in the mornings.
  "......"
  But today, Sakura doesn't go.
  "Sakura? Are you not feeling well?"
  "...No, that's not it, but... um, would you like to come to the dojo?"
- "No, I've no business there. Anyways, Issei asked for me, so I have to go
  to the student council room today."
  "...I-I see. Sorry for troubling you then."
  Sakura bows.
  "Hm?"
  "I'll be going now. Please look forward to dinner tonight."
  Sakura runs off like she's ashamed of something.
  "...?"
  Hm? I wonder what that was all about...?
  "Issei, you there?"
  "I am. You're a bit late today, Emiya."
  He must have been studying, as Issei looks up from the paper he's
  reading.
  "Just you, Issei? Where are the others? Shouldn't they be here now as
  well?"
  "No. Unfortunately, our members are very businesslike.
  They have their set work hours, and they don't want to come in early or
  stay late."
  "That's why the student council president is doing the routine duties
  himself, huh? I guess this place has its own problems."
  "No, it's the kind of trouble I like. You don't need to pity me."
  "Huh? Uh, no, I wasn't pitying you or anything."
  "Hm. I'm not happy about that either, but I'll pretend I didn't hear it. It
  still means that you care."
  Issei, who is organizing the papers he was reading, is the big boss of this
  student council room.
  He's the guy trying his best to reform this lax student council, and he's
  been a friend of mine since first year.
  His full name is Ryudou Issei.
  Despite his old-fashioned name, he has elegant features and he's really
  popular with the girls.
  And he's also the student council president, so you'd think he'd take to it
  like a duck to water, but...
- "Hm. Hot tea is certainly a good way to start a morning."
  He's just sipping tea like this, so he's not that firm.
  As you can see, Issei has a plain personality.
  It's easily misunderstood, but he doesn't involve himself in love affairs
  nor engage in normal student recreations.
  It's because he's the successor of the Ryudou Temple, up in the
  mountains.
  He's fine with that idea, so there's a good chance he'll shave his head
  when he graduates.
  "So, what am I doing today?"
  "Hm? Well, I'd like to let you sit down and take a rest first... but I guess
  we don't have time. I'll explain as we go, so bring your usual tools and
  follow me."
  "Frankly, our school's budget is completely unbalanced."
  "I know. The athletic clubs are favored, so other clubs don't get much,
  right?"
  "Right. As a result, members of the other clubs are in trouble.
  I'm working hard to make the budget go to them, but I'm having trouble
  because it's not clear where the money's going.
  In particular, there's no solution for the shortages of heaters during
  winter."[l]
  "I see. Oh, can you hand me the torque screwdriver? The biggest one.
  And the conductive wire too.
  ...Yeah, I should be able to fix this."
  "Conductive wire? ...Uh, is this it? Sorry, I don't know exactly.[l]
  Tell me if I'm wrong."
  "You're right. So, what was that about the shortage of heaters? Are there
  other broken ones?"
  "Yes. In the 2nd AV room and the art club. The petitions requesting new
  stoves are multiplying."
  "But there's not enough budget to meet the demand, huh? As I thought,
  it's just getting old.
  Good thing it's not broken on the inside."
