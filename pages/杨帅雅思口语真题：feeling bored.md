- Do you often feel bored?
-
- Yeah, absolutely. I believe everybody does, right?Boredom is a kind of feeling that we get all the time, so I suppose I feel bored just from time to time in a day. I mean, sometimes in the mid-afternoon, I just feel like if I'm not super busy and if I have nothing better to do, I just feel like, oh my God, what am I supposed to do right now? So yeah, of course, I believe I'm the same as everybody else. I get bored all the time.
-
- When was the last time you felt bored?
-
- Oh, it was actually just about 5 minutes ago when I was waiting out there for you to come out and get me because I didn't have my phone and there was no one next to me that I could talk to. So I felt super bored.
-
- What do you do when you feel bored?
-
- Well, in most cases, when I feel like I have nothing better to do, I just, well, I just use my phone to read some news, you know, an app on my phone called Ginger Total today's Headlines or something like that. This is my favorite app because I can read a lot of news articles on various things, on entertainment, on sports, politics, and so on. You know, once in a while, I just read what is going on in the states, especially things about Donald Trump. I mean, that guy is pretty, [[Hilarious]]. So yeah, these are the things I do to drive away boredom.
