- [[Yawn]], what day is it?
- Yune's hair is a mess of [tangles]([[Tangle]]) and [curls]([[Curl]]). #card
- That's pretty [[Romantic]], actually.
- I [[Avert]] my [[Gaze]], which is exactly what Yune is doing.
- It seems we've both been [distracted]([[Distract]]) by the same thing. #card
	- Yune 和男主都在想吃 Forbidden fruit 的事情
- I can see better with the sunlight [filtering]([[Filter]]) through the branches, enough to know her [[Hypothesis]] makes no sense. #card
	- Yune 说可不可能是树上掉的苹果，显然不成立
