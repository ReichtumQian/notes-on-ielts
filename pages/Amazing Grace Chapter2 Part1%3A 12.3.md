## Morning
- 昨晚刚刚和 Yune 吃了 forbidden fruit
- [[Yawn]], what day is it?
- Yune's hair is a mess of [tangles]([[Tangle]]) and [curls]([[Curl]]). #card
- That's pretty [[Romantic]], actually.
- I [[Avert]] my [[Gaze]], which is exactly what Yune is doing.
- It seems we've both been [distracted]([[Distract]]) by the same thing. #card
	- Yune 和男主都在想吃 Forbidden fruit 的事情
- I can see better with the sunlight [filtering]([[Filter]]) through the branches, enough to know her [[Hypothesis]] makes no sense. #card
	- Yune 说可不可能是树上掉的苹果，显然不成立
- But no matter how hard we [[Ponder]] the possibilities, we come up empty.
- Yune's [[Hunch]] tend to be pretty [[Spot-on]].
- I try listening [[Intently]].
- Excitement races through my [veins]([[Vein]]) in [[Anticipation]] of what new adventures tomorrow brings.
