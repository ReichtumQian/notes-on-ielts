- 看了一副三个女神和 Paris 神的画（太文学了。。）
- Golden Apple. The food of [[Immorality]], given to the most [[Gorgeous]] goddess.
- The [[Owl]] [perched]([[Perch]]) on the tree directly behind her marks her as the goddess Minerva.
- The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of [[Dusk]]
- The owl is the [[Sacred]] pet of Minerva
- It is only after the breaking of [[Dawn]] that we know of the owl's [[Nocturnal]] [[Flight]].
- To know the future... I'm sure it's something everyone [yearns]([[Yearn]]) for at some point.
- The [[Nun]], dressed in a [[Habit]], [chuckles]([[Chuckle]]) softly at her own joke.
- She smiles slightly as she tells the [[Fantastical]] [[Myth]] of the Golden Apple.
- Yes, I know I'm [[Guilty]] of doing so quite often. Pardon my [[Indulgence]].
- I eagerly await your next visit to the St. Aria [[Academy]].
- I wonder what colors will someday [[Coat]] this [[Blank]] [[Canvas]].
- I realize I am floating on the [[Brink]] of [[Unconsciousness]].
- I [[Crawl]] forward through [[Hazy]] darkness, led by [fluttering]([[Flutter]]), firefly-like lights, just out of reach.
- 进入了一个未知世界（看不懂了。。）
- I see an [[Angel]].
- It may be nothing more than a [[Hallucination]] brought on by my severely wounded state.
- The extraordinary natural canvas [blooms]([[Bloom]]) with countless frozen snow-white [petals]([[Petal]]).
- The [dazzling]([[Dazzle]]) contrast of colors is so [[Brilliant]] that it takes my breath away.
- I spot a young girl at the water's edge, seemingly [conducting]([[Conduct]]) this [[Symphony]] of lights.
- Darkness [shrouds]([[Shroud]]) my [fading]([[Fade]]) consciousness. I [[Bid]] [[Farewell]] to the world of the living.
- Her speaking voice sounds [horrendously]([[Horrendous]]) [[Monotonous]].
