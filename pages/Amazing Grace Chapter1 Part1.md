- What a [[Relief]], I thought you might never wake up.
- Her name [swirls]([[Swirl]]) around in my head.
- She gives me an [amused]([[Amuse]]) smile.
- She now stands before me, [glowing]([[Glow]]) with an [[Aura]] that could almost be called angelic.
- As she speaks, she breathes a [[Sigh]] of relief, [clasping]([[Clasp]]) her hands in front of her chest.
	- 看到男主醒过来很欣慰
- It seems [[Genuine]], she's truly delighted.
- I'm not in bad enough shape for that. It's mainly just [[Muscle]] [[Soreness]].
- I'm not sure. I just had a [[Hunch]], I guess.
- I wanted to [[Hibernate]] until January, but then you woke me up.
	- 男主开玩笑说自己想冬眠到一月份
- My mind [conjures]([[Conjure]]) up an image of my backpack.
- I [[Swear]] I was wearing it on my back.
- I reach inside my right [[Pants]] pocket.
- Although I know what it's used for, the word itself [slips]([[Slip]]) through my [[Grasp]] like [[Mist]].
- My [joints]([[Joint]]) [[Groan]] in [[Protest]] as I get to my feet.
- Despite the [[Rip]] in my shirt, my clothes are cleaner than I expected.
- Isn't it a [[Demon]] [infested]([[Infest]]) sodom out there?
- We climb up the [[Staircase]].
- An impossibly [[Vibrant]] town [stretches]([[Stretch]]) out below me.
- I spot several people walking along the [[Cobblestone]] streets that run between rows of [[Brick]] buildings, all [[Reminiscent]] of old European [[Architecture]].
- The cool wind [caresses]([[Caress]]) my [cheeks]([[Cheek]]), reminding me again of the [looming]([[Loom]]) winter.
- The cloudless sky is as [[Magnificent]] as the town spread out beneath it.
- The scene before me is, quite simply, [[Bizarre]].
