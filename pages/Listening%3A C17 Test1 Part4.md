- 「2」Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey, Ireland, Greece, and India.
- 「3」There are various designs of labyrinth but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area.
- 「4」There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area.
- 「5」Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns,
- 「6」but it's not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.
- 「7」In modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning and is often used as a synonym for a [[Maze]].
- 「8」A maze is quite different as it is a kind of puzzle with an intricate network of paths.
- 「9」Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe,and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces.
- 「10」The paths are usually surrounded by thick,high hedges so that it's not possible to see over them.
- 「11」Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times before using logic to work out the pattern and find your way to the centre and then out again.
- 「12」There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started.
- 「13」The word ‘maze’ is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion.This is where the word ‘amazing’ comes from.
- 「14」Labyrinths,on the other hand,have a very different function. Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths,
- 「15」this is not how they were seen in the past.
- 「16」The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life's journey.
- 「17」It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives and helped to give people a sense of direction.
- 「18」Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm and have been used as a meditation and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.
- 「19」The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into stone, from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa.
- 「20」In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age.
- 「21」The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology.
- 「22」In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiral was used on coins around four thousand years ago.
- 「23」Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses, villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.
- 「24」In Northern Europe,there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on.
- 「25」
- These were cut into the turf or grass,usually in a circular pattern. The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear,
- 「26」
- but they were probably used for fertility rites which may date back thousands of years.
- 「27」
- Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today,including the largest one at Saffron Walden,England,which used to have a large tree in the middle of it.
- 「28」
- More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival.
- 「29」
- Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness,
- 「30」
- and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits,which include slower breathing and a restored sense of balance and perspective.
- 「31」
- This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas,wellness centres and even prisons in recent years.
- 「32」
- A pamphlet at Colorado Children’s Hospital informs patients that ‘walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis’.
- 「33」
- And apparently,it's not only patients who benefit.
- 「34」
- Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room.Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks.
- 「35」
- In some hospitals,patients who can't walk can have a paper finger labyrinth' brought to their bed.
- 「36」
- The science behind the theory is a little sketchy,but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths.
- 「37」
- For example, one study found that walking a labyrinth provided ‘short-term calming, relaxation, and relief from anxiety’ for Alzheimer’s patients.
- 「38」
- So,what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal? Well...
