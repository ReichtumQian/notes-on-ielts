- Charles Spencer’s latest book, To Catch a King, tells us the story of the hunt for King Charles II in the six weeks after his [resounding]([[Resound]]) defeat at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. And what a story it is. After his father was [executed]([[Execute]]) by the Parliamentarians in 1649, the young Charles II sacrificed one of the very principles his father had died for and did a deal with the [Scots]([[Scot]]), [[Thereby]] accepting Presbyterianism* as the national [[Religion]] in return for being crowned King of Scots. His arrival in Edinburgh [prompted]([[Prompt]]) the English Parliamentary army to invade [[Scotland]] in a pre-emptive strike. This was followed by a [[Scottish]] invasion of England. The two sides finally faced one another at Worcester in the west of England in 1651. After being [[Comprehensively]] defeated on the [meadows]([[Meadow]]) outside the city by the Parliamentarian army, the 21-year-old king found himself the [[Subject]] of a national [[Manhunt]], with a huge sum offered for his capture. Over the following six weeks he managed, through a series of heart-poundingly close escapes, to [[Evade]] the Parliamentarians before seeking [[Refuge]] in France. For the next nine years, the [[Penniless]] and defeated Charles wandered around Europe with only a small group of [[Loyal]] supporters.
- Years later, after his [[Restoration]] as king, the 50-year-old Charles II requested a meeting with the writer and diarist Samuel Pepys. His [[Intention]] when asking Pepys to commit his story to paper was to ensure that this most extraordinary [[Episode]] was never forgotten. Over two three-hour sittings, the king related to him in great detail his personal [recollections]([[Recollection]]) of the six weeks he had spent as a [[Fugitive]]. As the king and secretary settled down (a scene that is surely a gift for a future scriptwriter), Charles [commenced]([[Commence]]) his story: ‘After the battle was so absolutely lost as to be beyond hope of recovery, I began to think of the best way of saving myself.’
