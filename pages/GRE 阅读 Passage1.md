- Although social learning (the [[Acquisition]] of specific behaviors by observing other individuals exhibiting those behaviors ) is well documented among fish, few studies have [investigated]([[Investigate]]) social learning within a developmental [[Context]] in these [[Taxa]]. Rather than investigating the development of a particular skill, Chapman, Ward, and Krause investigated the role of group density during development in later [foraging]([[Forage]]) success in laboratory-housed [guppies]([[Guppy]]). When raised with a small number of [conspecifics]([[Conspecific]]) (members of the same [species]([[Species]])), guppies were quicker to locate food by following a trained adult guppy than were guppies raised in large groups. This [[Counterintuitive]] finding is explained by the fact that guppies [reared]([[Rear]]) in the high-density condition were less likely to [[Shoal]] (swim in a group ) with others and, therefore, were less likely to learn the benefits of social learning. Instead, fish reared in high-density situations may learn that conspecifics are to be viewed as competitors, rather than as potential sources of adaptive information. This finding suggests that at least for guppies, the early social environment may have an effect on the capacity for social learning, if not on the socially learned behaviors themselves.
- 1. The primary purpose of the passage is to B
  A. note a [[Flaw]] in a scientific finding
  B. describe a particular scientific study
  C. present an [[Interpretation]] of a finding
  D. note a difference between two scientific findings
  E. [[Contrast]] two conditions in which a particular phenomenon has been observed
- 2. Regarding research on fish, it can be [inferred]([[Infer]]) from the passage that
  A. research studies of the [[Acquisition]] of important skills by fish have only recently begun to document the role of conspecifics in the learning process
  B. research on social learning in guppies suggests that guppies differ in important ways from most other fish in the means by which they learn particular skills
  C. research on social learning in fish has generally focused on the acquisition of skills other than [foraging]([[Forage]])
  D. research has established that social learning occurs in some fish species without investigating the development context in which it occurs.
  E. research to investigate social learning has been done more extensively on fish than on other [[Aquatic]] animals.
- 3. Which of the following can be inferred about the study by Chapman, Ward, and Krause?
  A. It was initially designed to investigate something other than social learning.
  B. It required researchers to observe individual guppies at multiple points in their life [spans]([[Span]]).
  C. It pointed to the possibility that population density may have little to do with guppiesâ€™ social learning.
  D. It required the observation of guppies under conditions that closely [mimicked]([[Mimick]]) the conditions of guppies in the wild.
  E. It indicated that guppies gain adaptive information from being reared with a relatively large number of conspecifics.
