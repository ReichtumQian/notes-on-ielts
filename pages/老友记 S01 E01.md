- Chandler: All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a [[Hump]]? A hump and a [[Hairpiece]]?
- Phoebe: Wait, does he eat [[Chalk]]?
- Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to [[Go through]] what I went through with Carl- oh!
- Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my [[Throat]], grabbed my small [[Intestine]], pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck
- Ross: No, no don't! Stop [cleansing]([[Cleanse]]) my [[Aura]]!
- Joey: And you never knew she was a [[Lesbian]].
- Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep [fixating]([[Fixate]]) on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
- Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some [[Hormones]]!
- Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet [bridesmaids]([[Bridesmaid]])?
- Rachel: I was looking at this [[Gravy]] [[Boat]]. This really [[Gorgeous]] Limoges gravy boat.
- Rachel: I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really [freaked out]([[Freak out]]), and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
- Rachel: So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda [[Drifted apart]], but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
- Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe [[Organ]], and she's really not happy about it.
- Rachel: What if I wanna be a [[Purse]]? It's a [[Metaphor]], Daddy!
